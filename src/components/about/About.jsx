                                    <p> I am an aspiring product designer based in <div className="my-story-location">üìçToronto. </div></p>

                                    <p> My journey into UX and product design stemmed from an interest in technology, applied psychology, and art during my last year of university. Product and UX design resonates with me as I have the ability to make a social impact. Similar to development, as a designer I am able to solve complex business problems and deliver tangible results.

                                    <p>
                                        Coming from a non-traditional design background I have taught myself UX and a tad bit of front-end development with lots of coffee, Youtube videos, and wonderful individuals! With my economics background, I am able to understand the market. This is beneficial as a UX designer because I am able to cater my design strategy to reflect market sentiments. Given my multidisciplinary background, I am a designer driven to create better experiences and solutions by being empathetic, curious, and strategic.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Since then, I have been looking for opportunities to practice UX/ UI to build my knowledge in design and provide a social impact. Outside of UX, I like to travel around üó∫Ô∏è, try new cuisines üçΩ, and read a nice book with a cup of coffee ‚òï. Recently, I have been swept into the world of digital illustration ‚úçüèº.
