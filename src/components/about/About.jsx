                                        As a designer, I've always been
                                        fascinated by the impact design has on
                                        our daily lives. From the products we
                                        use to the services we rely on, I've
                                        seen firsthand how good design can make
                                        a difference in the way we experience
                                        the world around us.

                                        I am currently a product designer at
                                        InnoSoft, responsible for owning the 1 ‚Üí 2 growth phase of Fusion Play.
                                        Prior to that, I worked on 0 ‚Üí 1
                                        solutions for a new business vertical
                                        and helped design for our core product,
                                        Fusion.

                                        Outside of design, I've been exploring
